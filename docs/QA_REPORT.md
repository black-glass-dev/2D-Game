## Outstanding test requirements

- Real Godot headless launch after every code-bearing batch.
- Menu, touch, mouse, keyboard, gamepad and Android-back matrix after M2/M3.
- `MP_RF_02` bot navigation/floor/link/hazard tests before Gate 2 approval.
- Draw calls, visible triangles, texture memory, audio voice count and load timing at each Highrise quality tier.
- Physical Android install/launch/control test before a physical-device-final claim.
